wdiff: GNU wdiff (comparison of files on a word per word basis)
wdiff:
wdiff: GNU wdiff is a front end to diff for comparing files on a word per
wdiff: word basis.  A word is anything between whitespace. This is useful
wdiff: for comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed and
wdiff: for which paragraphs have been refilled.  It works by creating two
wdiff: temporary files, one word per line, and then executes diff on these
wdiff: files.  It collects the diff output and uses it to produce a nicer
wdiff: display of word differences between the original files.
